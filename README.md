# 📁 Databricks Study Exercises — Backup Repository

Welcome! This repository serves as a personal backup and archive of study exercises I’ve completed while learning and experimenting with **Databricks**, including notebooks and sample data files.

## 🔍 Purpose

This project is **not a polished product or public-facing demo** — it’s simply my workspace for:

- Exploring Databricks features and workflows
- Practicing Python, Spark, SQL, and data engineering concepts
- Backing up notebooks and configuration used during study sessions

## 📘 Contents

- `/` – My exploratory work using notebooks in Databricks
- `data/` – Sample data used for testing and analysis

## 🧠 Notes

These files reflect my personal learning journey and may include incomplete code, draft comments, or sample outputs. If you find anything helpful, feel free to explore and adapt — but keep in mind this was built for study purposes.

## 📬 Contact

If you'd like to discuss anything or swap learning tips, feel free to reach out!
